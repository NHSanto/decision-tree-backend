# Decision Tree Processing Backend

This project implements a decision tree processing backend in **TypeScript**. The backend allows customers to define and execute business logic using a decision tree structure. The decision tree supports several action types and is extensible for future action additions.

## Features

- **Serialization & Deserialization**: Decision trees can be represented in JSON format and parsed back into executable structures.
- **Supported Actions**:
  - **SendEmail**: Sends an email (logs a message with sender/receiver details).
  - **SendSMS**: Sends an SMS (logs a message with the phone number).
  - **Condition**: Evaluates JavaScript expressions and branches based on the result.
  - **Loop**: Repeats a subtree a specified number of times.
- **Extensibility**: Easily register new actions via configuration.
- **Backend Execution**: A backend service that receives a JSON decision tree, deserializes it, and executes the defined actions.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (>=20.x)
- **npm** or **yarn**
